### Steps to do group capture, find and replace

1. Understand the requirement: what needs to be replaced? what should be the replacement?
2. Represent the patterns using regex, Enclose the pattern(s) that need to 
   be replaced with parenthesis to segregate them into capture groups.
3. Come up with the substitution  string by using the capture groups in the 
   replacement string.
4. Use a regex enabled find and replace engine to do the replacement.
