### Code Explanation

1. **Array of Strings**:
   ```javascript
   const str = ['1280x720', '1920x1600', '1024x768', '3840x2160', '99x99']
   ```
    - An array `str` contains strings representing different resolutions.

2. **Regular Expression**:
   ```javascript
   const regex = /(\d+)x(\d+)/
   ```
    - This regular expression matches strings with one or more digits (`\d+`), followed by the character 'x', followed by one or more digits.
    - Parentheses `()` are used to `create capture groups` for the digits before and after 'x'.

3. **Mapping and Replacing**:
   ```javascript
   const result = str.map((item) => item.replace(regex, '$1 pix by $2 pix'))
   console.log(result)
   ```
    - The `map` function creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.
    - The `replace` method uses the regular expression to find matches and replace them with a new string.
    - `$1` and `$2` are placeholders for the first and second `capture groups` from the regular expression, representing the width and height, respectively.
    - The new string format is `'$1 pix by $2 pix'`.

The `$1` and `$2` syntax is part of the regular expression (regex) functionality in JavaScript.

### Explanation
- **Regular Expressions**: In JavaScript, regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are also objects.
- **Capture Groups**: Parentheses `()` in a regex create capture groups. These groups can be referenced later in the replacement string.
- **Backreferences**: `$1`, `$2`, etc., are backreferences in the replacement string. They refer to the content captured by the first, second, etc., set of parentheses in the regex.

### Example in Code
- **Regex**: `/(\d+)x(\d+)/`
    - `(\d+)` captures one or more digits before 'x'.
    - `(\d+)` captures one or more digits after 'x'.
- **Replacement String**: `'$1 pix by $2 pix'`
    - `$1` refers to the first capture group (digits before 'x').
    - `$2` refers to the second capture group (digits after 'x').

### Summary
- `$1` and `$2` are part of the regex syntax in JavaScript, used within the `replace` method to refer to captured groups from the regex pattern.
